Configuring Git   Check Git Version   git --version   Ensure Git is installed correctly.   Set Global Git Configuration   git config --global user.name \"miftah-ahmad-choiri\" git config --global user.email \"miftahcoiri354@gmail.com\"   Verify settings:   git config --list   For organization login:  git config --global user.name \"Miftah-Choiri\" git config --global user.email \"miftah.choiri@ibm.com\" git config -list     🔐 2. Setting Up SSH for GitHub   Generate SSH Key   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"miftahcoiri354@gmail.com\"   Press Enter to accept defaults and optionally set a passphrase.   Start SSH Agent   eval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\"   Add SSH Key to Agent   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519   Add SSH Key to GitHub      Display the public key:     cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub           Copy the key.   Go to GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key.   Paste the key and save.   Test SSH Connection   ssh -T git@github.com   Successful output:   Hi miftah-ahmad-choiri!

Pull Existing Repository   Pull existing repository to local   git remote add origin git@github.com:miftah-ahmad-choiri/how-to-setup-github.git git pull origin main # or git pull git@github.com:miftah-ahmad-choiri/how-to-setup-github.git  git remote -v git remote set-url origin git@github.com:miftah-ahmad-choiri/miftah-ahmad-choiri.github.io.git git pull origin master     🗂️ 5. Branching and Merging   Create and Switch to a New Branch   git checkout -b edit-readme   Push the Branch to GitHub   git push -u origin edit-readme   Merge Changes into Main Branch   git checkout main git merge edit-readme git push origin main   Move repo directory to new directory  cp -r how-to-setup-github/ repository/ rm -rf how-to-setup-github/   Remove and Reconnect to remote repository  git remote remove origin git remote -r  git remote add origin git@github.com:miftah-ahmad-choiri/how-to-setup-github.git git remote -r   Delete branch &amp; remote branch  git branch -d edit-readme git branch -D edit-readme git push origin --delete edit-readme   Verify branch  git branch git branch -r  Safely Delete .git directory  # remove .git file from repo directory cd how-to-setup-github rm -rf .git cd .. rm -rf how-to-setup-github     ⚙️ 6. Using GitHub CLI (Optional)   Verify GitHub CLI Installation   gh --version   Authenticate with GitHub   gh auth login   Follow the prompts to authenticate via browser.   Create Repository Using GitHub CLI   gh repo create how-to-setup-github --public --source=. --remote=origin --push   Open Repository in Browser   gh repo view --web     📝 7. Troubleshooting Common Issues           Repository Not Found:       ERROR: Repository not found.           Fix: Verify repository URL and access permissions.            Remote Already Exists:       error: remote origin already exists.           Fix: Remove existing remote and add again:       git remote remove origin git remote add origin git@github.com:USERNAME/REPO.git             💡 8. Helpful Commands      List branches:     git branch -a           Check remote repositories:     git remote -v           View repository list:     gh repo list             ✅ Conclusion   This guide covers the end-to-end process of setting up GitHub on your PC, configuring Git, managing SSH keys, creating repositories, and working with branches.
