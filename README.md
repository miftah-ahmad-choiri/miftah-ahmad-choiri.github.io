## 📋 **Before Editing**

### 1️⃣ **Sync with Deployed App**
Ensure your local repository is up-to-date with the deployed version:
```bash
cd miftah-ahmad-choiri.origin.io
git pull origin deploy
```

### 2️⃣ **Create a New Branch**
Switch to a new branch named `develop`:
```bash
git branch -M develop
```

### 3️⃣ **Check Current Version Tag**
Verify the current version tag before making changes:
```bash
git tag
```
If no tags exist, create an initial version tag:
```bash
git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Releasing version 0.1.0"
git tag
```
**Example Output:**
```text
v0.1.0
```

### 4️⃣ **Create a New Tag for the Upgrade**
Tag the repository for the new version and push it to the remote:
```bash
git tag -a v0.1.1 -m "Releasing version 0.1.1"
git push origin v0.1.1
git tag
```
**Example Output:**
```text
v0.1.0
v0.1.1
```

## 💻 **Develop Software**

Make changes, track modifications, and commit your updates:
```bash
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Create new features or fix code"
git push -u origin develop
```

---

## 🚀 **After Editing**

### 📦 **Publish a New Release**
Authenticate with GitHub CLI and create a new release:
```bash
gh auth login
gh release list
gh release create v0.1.1 --title "Release v0.1.1" --notes "Create new feature and fix code"
gh release list
```

✅ **All done! Your changes have been successfully committed and released.** 🎉
